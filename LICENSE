## License Grant

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organization obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Software, subject to the following conditions:

## Free Use

You may use this Software for free if you meet ANY of these criteria:

1. **Personal Use**: You are using the Software for personal, non-commercial purposes, including students using it for educational purposes.

2. **Small Business**: You are a business or organization whose total gross revenue from all sources in the most recent twelve (12) month period does not exceed US$500,000.

3. **Non-Profit**: You are a registered non-profit organization (excluding educational institutions, which are subject to the revenue threshold).

### Why Educational Institutions Must Pay

Educational institutions are explicitly excluded from free use because:

1. **For-Profit Status**: Many educational institutions operate as for-profit entities.

2. **Massive Endowments**: Non-profit educational institutions often possess endowments worth billions of dollars, extracted through predatory pricing practices and exploitative student loan systems.

3. **Exploitative Pricing**: These institutions charge inflated tuition costs while sitting on enormous wealth, burdening students with decades of debt.

4. **Ability to Pay**: If an institution can charge students tens of thousands of dollars per year, it can afford to pay for the software it uses.

**Note**: Individual students using this software for personal educational purposes are always welcome to use it for free. This restriction applies only to institutional use by the educational organizations themselves.
